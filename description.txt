Craftable Master Mode Relics, by Setnour6.

This mod allows you to craft master mode relics in expert mode, so you don't have to struggle to defeat the master mode bosses, and you don't even have to be in master mode to make relics!

This mod contains recipes for all vanilla master mode boss relics.
This mod also contains boss relic recipes for the following 1.4 mods:
- Vitality Mod

> All relics are to be crafted with 25 gold or platinum bars, a boss summoning item, and respective boss loot at both a demon altar and an anvil at the same time (because it's master mode stuff, it's supposed to be that challenging).
> You will also need certain items to craft the relics with.
